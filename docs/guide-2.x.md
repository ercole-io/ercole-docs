# FE.APIService.RemoteEndpoint = "https://<myip>/api"
# FE.ChartService.RemoteEndpoint = "https://<myip>/chart"
```
* If your machine has multiple IP addresses, check and fix endpoints in `/etc/ercole/conf.d/20-ercolesetup.toml`.
* If you want change the URI used to connect to mongodb, run the command `echo 'Mongodb.URI = "mongodb://user:pass@ip:port/ercole"' > /etc/ercole/conf.d/40-mongoconf.toml` with the right [Mongo URI](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/connection-string/).
* Review ercole configuration with `ercole show-config`
* If you have changed ercole configuration, run the command `ercole-setup`
* `systemctl start ercole`
* `systemctl start enable nginx` 
* `systemctl start nginx`

#### Troubleshooting

##### Failed (13: Permission denied) while connecting to upstream in /var/log/nginx/error.log
If curl https://127.0.0.1/repo/ping.txt doesn't return PONG! but returns nginx's 404 page and `/var/log/nginx/error.log` contains lines like
```
2020/08/03 09:25:01 [crit] 77642#0: *16 connect() to 127.0.0.1:11111 failed (13: Permission denied) while connecting to upstream, client: 127.0.0.1, server: _, request: "GET /data/ping HTTP/1.1", upstream: "http://127.0.0.1:11111/ping", host: "127.0.0.1"
``` 
Execute the command `setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect 1`.

### Requirements
|     Component     | Prerequisite                                 |
|:-----------------:|----------------------------------------------|
| Operating system  | CentOS, RedHat, OracleLinux 7/8              |
| RAM               | 4GB                                          |
| Filesystem        | 50GB (minimum)                               |
| CPU               | 2 VirtualCPU                                 |
| Database          | MongoDB >= 4.2.0                             |

#### Minimal default required network/firewall rules
|          From          |         To           |  Port |   Proto   |
|:----------------------:|----------------------|-------|-----------|
| agents                 | ercole-dataservice   | 11111 | HTTP[1]   |
| users                  | ercole-apiservice    | 11113 | HTTP[1]   |
| users                  | ercole-chartservice  | 11116 | HTTP[1]   |
| users                  | ercole-reposervice   | 11114 | HTTP[1]   |

| agents                 | ercole-reposervice   | 11115 | SSH       |

[1] It is highly recommended to setup a reverse proxy between users/agents and ercole for avoiding to comunicate directly to the microservices using HTTP and opening too much ports, using for example nginx. See the istructions below.

##### Suggested network/firewall rules
|          From          |         To           |  Port |   Proto   |
|:----------------------:|----------------------|-------|-----------|
| ercole-reposervice     | *.github.com         |  443  | HTTPS[1]  |
| ercole-reposervice     | repository.ercole.io |  443  | HTTPS[1]  |

[1] You can safely separate ercole-reposervice from the others microservices.
### Installation guide
This installation guide is for RHEL8, but the steps can be easily adapted for RHEL7 .

* `curl https://repository.ercole.io/shared/ercole-rhel8-x86_64.repo | tee /etc/yum.repos.d/ercole-x86_64.repo`
* `yum install ercole`
* If your machine has multiple IP addresses, check and fix endpoints in `/etc/ercole/conf.d/20-ercolesetup.toml`
* Review ercole configuration with `ercole show-config`
* `systemctl start ercole`

Ercole is configured automatically during the installation but you can edit the configuration by creating/files in `/etc/ercole/conf.d`. Its logs can be read with the command `journalctl -u ercole-dataservice -u ercole-alertservice -u ercole-apiservice -u ercole-reposervice -u ercole-chartservice` and can be updated as usually with a simple `yum update` unless in the new versions were introduced breaking changes.
It is also recommeded to also install [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/).
After the installation you may want to [install ercole-web and configure nginx](#installation-guide-2) or to [install artifacts](#various-howto-examples).

### Ercole configuration
The configuration is written in [TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) syntax and it is stored in these files/directory in ascending order of priority. The properties specified in low priority configuration files are overriden by the values in high priority configuration files. The configurations files are:
* `/opt/ercole/config.toml` (legacy config file) 
* `/usr/share/ercole/config.toml` (distributor config file)
* `/etc/ercole/ercole.toml`
* `/etc/ercole/conf.d/*.toml`
    * `/etc/ercole/conf.d/20-ercolesetup.toml` is a file created by `ercole-setup` utility that contains known host specific configuration like remote endpoints, paths to certificates/keys and inter microservice configuration params.
* `~/.config/ercole.toml`
* `./config.toml`
* An optional file specified to the `ercole` using the `-c` option.

It's highly recommended to configure it by creating files in `/etc/ercole/conf.d` (e.g `/etc/ercole/conf.d/50-myconf.toml`). If you change the `RemoteEndpoint`s of the microservices you may need to re-run `ercole-setup`(or `ercoleweb-setup` if you have installed ercole-web).

### Notes about the internal repository
Ercole repository is tought to be public and visibile to everyone so it shouldn't contains private informations like the password or private keys. The main ercole repository is [https://repository.ercole.io](https://repository.ercole.io). It is served via HTTP and via SFTP so you can download files in various mode like:
*   `wget http://myawesomeercole2.local:11114/ping.txt`
*   `curl http://myawesomeercole2.local:11114/ping.txt > /tmp/ping.txt`
*   `sftp -P 11115 myawesomeercole2.local/ping.txt /tmp/ping.txt`
Some repository files/directory are managed using the `ercole repo` subcommands. Others files/directories can be safely modified.

Managed files:
    * `ping.txt` is a file used to check the liveness of the microservices. It's really managed but it's recommended to not modify it.
    * `index.json` contains the cached list of available artifacts. Can be safely removed for forcing the rebuild of the cache when the next `repo` subcommands is run.
    * `all/` contains the symlinks to all installed (and managed) artifacts.
    * `rhel/*` contains the RPM repositories of the packages for every RHEL versions.
    * `win/*` contains various ercole-agent setup files for windows.
    * `aix/` contains the RPM repositories of the packages for every AIX versions.
    * `aix-tar-gz/` alternative artifacts of agents for AIX.
    * `hpux/` contains the agents for HPUX.
    
Unmanaged known files:
    * `shared/` contains various files like some .repo files.
    * `snapshots/` is a directory present in [https://repository.ercole.io](https://repository.ercole.io) that is used to store snapshots of all projects. The snapshots aren't tought to be used outside the development.

The public repository don't serve files via SFTP.
It may be a good idea to create multiple ercole reposervice for directory for stable/testing/unstable or PRD/COL/TST.
### (main) ercole usage
Ercole is a command line tool so it can be used to perform some.

* `ercole version` print the version of ecole.
* `ercole show-config` show the ercole's actual configuration.
* `ercole fire-hostdata` send a hostdata stored in a json file or from a stdin to ercole-dataservice.
* `ercole migrate` migrate the structure of the mongodb database from a previous one to the latest.
* `ercole serve` start the services. Every microservices can be turned on/off esplicitily using the various --enable options like --enable-dataservice.
* `ercole api` is a group of subcommands used to perform request data from ercole-apiservice.
* `ercole chart` is a group of subcommands used to perform request data from ercole-chartservice.
* `ercole repo` is a group of subcommands used to manage the repository. Can accept the command --rebuild-cache to force the rebuild of the cache stored in `/var/lib/ercole/distributed_directory/index.json`.
    * `... list` lists the artifacts detected in the upstream repositories.
    * `... info` get the informations about the specified artifacts.
    * `... install` download and install the specified artifacts.
    * `... remove` uninstall the specified artifacts.
    * `... update` try to find newer version of all installed artifacts and install them.

### Various HOWTO/examples

#### How to install a artifact
*   The first thing to do is to find the available artifacts by running the command: ```ercole repo list```
*   Choose the artifact you want.
*   Install it with for example with the command: ```ercole repo install ercole-agent/ercole-agent-rhel7@1.5.0```

#### Install a package to rhelX from the ercole-reposervice
The first thing to do is to create a repository file .
* `curl https://repository.ercole.io/shared/ercole-rhel7-x86_64.repo | tee /etc/yum.repos.d/ercole.repo`

The next thing is to install the package with yum or dnf.
* `yum install ercole-agent` 

## Ercole-web
Ercole-web is the official optional frontend of the ercole.io project

### Requirements

|     Component     | Prerequisite                                 |
|:-----------------:|----------------------------------------------|
| Operating system  | CentOS, RedHat, OracleLinux 7/8              |
| RAM               | 512MB                                        |
| Filesystem        | 2GB (minimum)                                |
| CPU               | 1 VirtualCPU                                 |

### Installation guide
This installation guide is for RHEL8, but the steps can be easily adapted for RHEL7.

* `curl https://repository.ercole.io/shared/ercole-rhel8-noarch.repo | tee /etc/yum.repos.d/ercole-noarch.repo`
* `yum install ercole-web`
The website files can be found under `/usr/share/ercole/web/`.
If you want setup nginx for serving the files and proxy-pass you can follow this [HOWTO](#how-to-setup-ercole-ercole-web-with-nginx-and-proxypass).

### Configuration
Ercole-web has a single file and it's stored in `/usr/share/ercole/web/config.json`. The file isn't tought to be modified by hand but it's generated by `ercoleweb-setup` util using the values inside the file `/etc/ercole/conf.d/20-ercolesetup.toml`.

## Ercole-agent and ercole-agent-perl
Ercole-agent and ercole-agent-perl are the data collectors that fetches some informations from various sources like the host and the software. Organize them in a JSON structure called hostdata and send them to the dataservice. 

### Differences
There are two different variant of ercole-agent: ercole-agent (go) and ercole-agent-perl. Their main differences are the programming language, operating system support and feature/targets support. It's advised to stick to ercole-agent (go)
